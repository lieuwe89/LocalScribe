"""Multi-device sync endpoints — snapshot + delta.

Wire shape::

    GET /sync/snapshot
        -> { workspace_id, cursor, transcripts: [...] }

    GET /sync/since/{cursor}
        -> { workspace_id, cursor, transcripts: [...] }

``cursor`` is a numeric value: the largest ``json_mtime`` (unix epoch
seconds, float, sub-second precision where the filesystem supports it)
present in the response. A device reads ``cursor``, stores it locally,
and passes the same value back on the next ``/sync/since`` call to
receive only what changed in between.

Why mtime, not Lamport?
-----------------------

The workspace-wide Lamport counter tracks per-field CRDT op ordering,
but a freshly-transcribed transcript (no edits yet) has all clocks at
0. A Lamport-based cursor would miss those. ``json_mtime`` advances
every time the writer atomically replaces a sidecar, which captures
both new transcripts and CRDT-modified ones uniformly. The two
concepts live side-by-side: clocks order edits *within* a transcript;
mtime orders *which transcripts changed*.

Authorisation
-------------

Both endpoints require a paired-device signature
(:func:`speechtotext.api.auth.verify_device_signature`). Same shape
as ``PATCH /transcripts/{id}``: ``X-Device-Id`` + ``X-Signature-B64``
over METHOD + "\\n" + PATH + "\\n" + body.
