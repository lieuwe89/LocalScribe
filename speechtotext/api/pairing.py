"""Hub-side pairing token mint + exchange.

Pairing flow (architecture plan §3.5):

1. Hub UI calls :meth:`PairingTokenStore.mint` (via the
   ``POST /pair/tokens`` endpoint) and renders the resulting token as
   a QR code on screen.
2. New device scans the QR. Together with the workspace_id and hub
   URL (which travel in the QR body), it generates its own Ed25519
   keypair and POSTs to ``/v1/pair`` with the token + its public key.
3. Hub validates the token (single-use, 5-minute TTL), sealedboxes
   the workspace symmetric key ``W`` to the device's pubkey (via
   Ed25519 → Curve25519 conversion), and returns the sealed payload
   along with a freshly assigned device_id.
4. Device decrypts ``W`` with its private key, stores it in its
   secure storage, and is now part of the workspace.

The token store is in-memory only — the hub runs as a single process
and pairing tokens are extremely short-lived. Across a hub restart
any in-flight tokens are lost; users re-issue. That's fine.
